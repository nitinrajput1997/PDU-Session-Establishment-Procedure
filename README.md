# PDU-Session-Establishment-Procedure

Whenever a new PDU Session is created, then this procedure is employed. Alternatively, when a PDU Session is handed over from non-3GPP access like Wi-Fi, at that time the PDU Session establishment procedure is used. Typically this procedure is always initiated by the device. But if the network would like to trigger it, then it can send the trigger message to a device. Following that message, the device will initiate the establishment procedure.
